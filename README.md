playground1
===========

For the moment you can control bouncing balls on each user screen, each user drives his ball with the accelerometer of his smartphone (like a remote to the desktop computer).
In the near futur, this could lead to a multi player game on desktop computer screen controlled by smartphone.

If you want to try it :

    npm node-static
    npm socket.io

    node /server/app.js

You may have to adjust hostname and port in /wwww/js/playground.common.js

This is a work in progress.
